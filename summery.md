### User eXperience (UX)
The "best UX" is artibrary per user. Some users prefer "best image quality" while others prefer "fast browsing", security, etc.
The best way I've ound to deal with this issue is rooted in an ancient Buddhist wisdom: "the middle path".
I'm not a Buddhist (yet), but for this assignment the following applies:
- no "bandwidth speed limitation" is speciied in the assignment, hence "best UX" is assumed
- even though the ***iPhone XS*** has a screen resolution of **2436 x 1125**, images will be served at a lower resolution in order to satisfy the "best UX requirement"
