### User eXperience (UX)
Regarding **images**, the "best UX" is artibrary per user. Some users (-or propreitors & publishers) prefer "best image quality" while others prefer "fast browsing", security, etc.
How to deal with this issue is rooted in an ancient Buddhist wisdom: "the middle path".
I'm not a Buddhist (yet); however, for this assignment "real world" limitations are assumed (in logical order):
1. no "resource probing" (-or "bootstrapping speed test") was mentioned and the end user may be ***data-usage-capped***
2. the user may have an impressive piece of tech, though the network they use to connect to the internet may be less impressive, depending on location, ISP, bandwidth-cap, signal quality, etc. -especially when targeting an international audience (-or international publisher franchise)
3. even though the ***iPhone XS*** has a screen resolution of **2436 x 1125**, images will be served at a lower resolution in order to satisfy assumed limitations
