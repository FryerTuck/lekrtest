### User eXperience (UX)
The "best UX" is artibrary per user. Some users (-or site propreitors) prefer "best image quality" while others prefer "fast browsing", security, etc.
How to deal with this issue is rooted in an ancient Buddhist wisdom: "the middle path".
I'm not a Buddhist (yet), but for this assignment the following applies:
- no "bandwidth speed limitation" is speciied, hence "real world" limitations are assumed
- the user may have an impressive piece of tech, though the network they use to connect to the internet may be less impressive, depending on location, ISP, bandwidth-cap, signal quality, etc.
- even though the ***iPhone XS*** has a screen resolution of **2436 x 1125**, images will be served at a lower resolution in order to satisfy assumed limitations
