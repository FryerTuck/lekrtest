# LekkeSlaap - candidate summary

### User eXperience (UX)
The "best UX" is artibrary per user. Some users (-or propreitors & publishers) prefer "best image quality" while others prefer "fast browsing", security, etc. (-depending on the purpose of the published assets).
How to deal with this issue is rooted in an ancient: "the middle path". I'm not a Taoist (yet); however, for this assignment "real world" limitations are assumed.

#### bootstrapping
- no ***framework*** was specified, hence "vanilla-js" & "vanilla-css" (plain javascript & css) is assumed
- no ***javascript detection*** is speciied, but is required to render the best UX, hence it is assumed as necessary and included
- no ***modern browser feature detection*** is specified, hence it is assumed as necessary and included
- no ***connection speed monitoring*** was mentioned, hence some "resource-hungry" assets are acquired sparingly; this feature will indeed improve UX, but is not included as it is not within the scope of this test, nor implied -or assumed.

#### regarding images 
1. the user may have an impressive piece of tech, though the network they use to connect to the internet may be less impressive, depending on location, ISP, bandwidth-cap, signal quality, etc. -especially when targeting an international audience (-or international publisher franchise)
2. even though the ***iPhone XS*** has a screen resolution of **2436 x 1125**, images will be served at a lower resolution in order to satisfy assumed limitations
