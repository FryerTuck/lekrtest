# LekkeSlaap - candidate summary

### User eXperience (UX)
The "best UX" is artibrary per user. Some users (-or propreitors & publishers) prefer "best image quality" while others prefer "fast browsing", security, etc. (-depending on the purpose of the published assets).
How to deal with this issue is rooted in an ancient wisdom: "the middle path". I'm not a Taoist (yet); however, for this assignment "real world" limitations are assumed.

#### bootstrapping
- no ***framework*** was specified, hence "vanilla-js" & "vanilla-css" (plain javascript & css) is assumed
- no ***javascript detection*** is speciied, but is required to render the best UX, hence it is assumed as unnecessary
- no ***modern browser feature detection*** is specified, hence it is assumed as unnecessary
- no ***connection speed monitoring*** was mentioned, hence it is assumed as unnecessary. Monitoring asset-size and delivery-time throughout the viitor's session in order to establish average connection speed and thereby determine multimedia quality based on this (e.g. SildeShare -or YouTube "auto") is outside the scope of this test.

#### regarding images 
1. the user may have an impressive piece of tech, though the network they use to connect to the internet may be less impressive, depending on location, ISP, bandwidth-cap, signal quality, etc. -especially when targeting an international audience (-or international publisher franchise)
2. even though the ***iPhone XS*** has a screen resolution of **2436 x 1125**, images will be served at a lower resolution in order to satisfy assumed limitations


### A picture says a thousand words
The primary attraction is ocussed on the images, the rest of the UI is minimal, yet functional.

### Time flies when you're having fun
Programmatically, this demo works, kindly have a look at the hand-coded scripts (JS, PHP) or more info
Unfortunately I've ran out of time to produce a "great looking" mockup, even so, with 2 more hours I could pull in
